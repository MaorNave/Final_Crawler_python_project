# Final_Crawler_python_project
The code featured in this research output embodies a crafted program designed to construct a web crawler tailored for a specific online platform - the IEEE academic journal. This crawler is engineered to undertake targeted data extraction operations, responding to stipulated research requisites. It subsequently generates an Excel-format data file as output, wherein each entry encapsulates pivotal information distilled from individual articles.
Integral to this endeavor is an elegantly structured output repository. This repository systematically compiles pertinent image data from articles across distinct annual epochs within the broader article chronology. The nomenclature of each repository folder precisely mirrors the appellation of the pertinent article in its corresponding year and decade, meticulously aligned with the journal's edition issue.
